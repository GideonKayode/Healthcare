Early Detection of Diabetes (In progress)

### Background:
A mobile health clinic wants to pre-screen patients for diabetes using basic health indicators to reduce hospital crowding and focus on at-risk individuals.

### Problem Statement:
Use EDA to uncover factors that greatly influence the risk of diabetes. Develop a classification model to predict if a person has diabetes based on attributes like BMI, glucose level, insulin levels and age.
